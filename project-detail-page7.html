                <h1>Teaching children Python and Scratch</h1>
                <h2></h2>
                <h3><b>Overview</b></h3>

<p>

  For the duration of third year I taught local primary school children programming through and organisation known as code club at Brompton Library. The materials taught were games written in scratch and python to be stimulating for the children.

</p>



<h2></h2>
				<h3><b>Skills</b></h3>

        <p><b>Teamwork:</b> There were normally two of us teaching to a group of 15 children which meant we had to work as a dynamic team as when the children became frustrated that something wasn’t working they would soon become disruptive to the rest of the group.</p>

<p><b>Improvisation:</b> School often fails able students due to its rigid nature. I ensure that the activities were tailored for each individual and ensured that they wouldn’t get bogged down and lose interest.</p>

<p><b>Communication:</b> After the first session or two, the children had a better understand of programming than the majority of adults. Being able to explain concepts to them was incredibly interesting as it built on my communication skills at being able to translate technical language to a form that non technical people can understand.</p>
