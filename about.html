            <h1>About</h1>
			<p>Hello, my name is Keyan Sadeghi Namaghi. I am a engineering student at Imperial College London pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronic and Electrical Engineering.
        I have always had unrelenting desire to try to understand how things work. This state of mind is what molded me into the person currently studying engineering today. </p>

        <p>
          I come from an very humble background, to the extent that the only way I could explain my field of study to my paternal grandparents was to say I study radio. This has led me to believe we
          all have a moral obligation to leave this world in a better place than the world we found and I truly believe advances in electronics hold the key for me to achieve this ambition.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my free time I enjoy hiking, rugby, going to the London Achalasia Meetup. I have recently began a course trying to improve my Welsh from fluent second language to hopefully be able to be comfortable to speak it as a first language.
        </p>
