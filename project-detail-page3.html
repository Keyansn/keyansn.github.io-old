                <h3><b>Overview</b></h3>

<p>The first receipt was launched back in 1892 and is still holding strong resulting in 10 million trees being cut down to make enough paper for receipts in the USA alone. Project ReceiptBook is the idea of digitizing this century old tradition and bringing it more in line with modern times. The ReceiptBook is essentially an application on the most portable computers on Earth, the smart phone, and utilises the Near Field Communication technology (NFC) that comes with the majority of smartphones. Users would just be simply required to scan their smartphones across a NFC transmitter connected to a pay register for the receipt to be transferred to the mobile device. No wires, no delays and most importantly no pesky paper receipts lingering in the wallet/purse. As well as saving countless amount of trees and preventing wildlife habitats from being destroyed, project ReceiptBook can help in minimising financial stress commonly found in young adults, more notably students. It does this by allowing budgeting with clear visual illustrations of where money is going alongside educational tips and tricks.

				<h3><b>Skills</b></h3>

        <p><b>Java:</b> Java was used as for writing a skin Android application for a web application. This was simply achieved using a webview and was done because developing the web application was much easier and quicker than a fully fledged native Application </p>

        <p><b>NFC:</b> NFC or Near Field Communication was used to send data from a laptop (which was simulating a point of sale device) to an Android application.</p>

        <p><b>JSON:</b> The receipts were stored in JSON format, learning and understanding how JSON works is very important as it is a universal machine readable format.</p>

        <p><b>MySQL:</b> A MySQL database was set up for storing data gathered from the receipts. This allows us to be able to analyse the userâ€™s spending habits and provide feedback on how to better manage their financing.</p>

        <p><b>HTML5:</b> A website was created using HTML5 to explain the project and what problems it overcomes.</p>
