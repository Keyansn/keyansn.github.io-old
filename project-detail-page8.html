                <h3><b>Overview</b></h3>
                <p>For our first year project we were tasked with building a robot powered by a microcontroller of out choice that is able to follow a line, then when breaking from the line it must spiral inwardly until finally coming to a stop. We took a pure digital approach and programmed a PIC using Assembly. </p>

                <p>The sensors used were originally regular LDRs but they were affected by natural light sources, which made them inaccurate. Instead we used an infrared emitter and phototransistor sensitive to infra-red.</p>

                <p>Due to the design of the wheels, or lack thereof, the robot was rather unpredictable and required a surprising amount of speed to be able to move the bug. It also meant that the bug had a tendency to always turn left which caused issues.</p>




<h2></h2>
				<h3><b>Skills</b></h3>

        <p><b>Teamwork:</b> There were normally two of us teaching to a group of 15 children which meant we had to work as a dynamic team as when the children became frustrated that something wasnâ€™t working they would soon become disruptive to the rest of the group.</p>

        <p><b>Microcontrollers:</b> Most members of the team had never used a microcontroller and it was the first time we got to put all the theory from our programming course into practice. I became very comfortable using a PIC to control a robot.</p>

        <p><b>Assembly:</b> Due to a mix up, we ended up programming the bug in Assembly which added an extra degree of complexity. It was however a good experience with low level programming as it is an appropriate use case. </p>
