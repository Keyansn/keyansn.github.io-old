                <h3><b>Overview</b></h3>

<p>In first year, the final programming coursework was to implement a multitude of algorithms for solving sudoku puzzles. Each having their own benefits and drawbacks with some being practical to use and others being completely unfeasible in some situation. This project was written in C++ and ultimately it was concluded that backtracking was the optimal solution to this problem.

</p>

<h2></h2>
				<h3><b>Skills</b></h3>

        <p><b>Complexity:</b> This project forced me to understand the orders of complexity of algorithms as it was all about trying to create the optimal solution and being able to explain why certain algorithms are a bad approach to the problem.</p>

        <p><b>Eclipse:</b> I am now familiar with using the incredibly popular Eclipse IDE.</p>

        <p><b>C++:</b> This project was essentially throwing me into the deep end of C++ programming which caused me to rapidly gain a sense of comfort when programming in C++ from now on as I feel it caused me to master the basics.</p>
